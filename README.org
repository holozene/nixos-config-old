#+title: NixOS Config
#+author: Emmet, Holozene



** What is this repository?
These are configuration files for a highly modular NixOS setup(s). Based on [[https://gitlab.com/librephoenix/nixos-config][LibrePhoenix's NixOS Repo]].

Here is the hyperland config:

** 55+ Themes
[[https://github.com/danth/stylix#readme][Stylix]] (and [[https://github.com/SenchoPens/base16.nix#readme][base16.nix]], of course) is amazing, allowing you to theme your entire system with base16-themes.

Using this we have [[./themes][55+ themes]] we can switch between on rebuild. Visit the [[./themes][themes directory]] for more info and screenshots!

** Install
librephoenix wrote some reinstall notes for quick reference [[./install.org][here (install.org)]].

** Modules
Separate Nix files can be imported as atomic modules using an import block:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
imports = [ ./import1.nix
            ./import2.nix
            ...
          ];
#+END_SRC

We have modules separated into two groups:
- System-level - stored in the [[./system][system directory]]
  - System-level modules are imported into configuration.nix, which is what is sourced into [[./flake.nix][the flake (flake.nix)]]
- User-level - stored in the [[./user][user directory]] (managed by home-manager)
  - User-level modules are imported into home.nix, which is also sourced into [[./flake.nix][the flake (flake.nix)]]

More detailed information on these specific modules are in the [[./system][system directory]] and [[./user][user directory]] respectively.

** Patches
In some cases, since this config is based in =nixpgs-unstable=, we must patch nixpkgs. This can be done inside of a flake via:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
    nixpkgs-patched = (import nixpkgs { inherit system; }).applyPatches {
      name = "nixpkgs-patched";
      src = nixpkgs;
      patches = [ ./example-patch.nix ];
    };

    # configure pkgs
    pkgs = import nixpkgs-patched { inherit system; };

    # configure lib
    lib = nixpkgs.lib;
#+END_SRC

Patches can either be local or remote, so we can even import unmerged pull requests by using =fetchpatch= and the raw patch url, i.e: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/example.patch.

I currently curate patches local to this repo in the [[./patches][patches]] directory.

** Profiles
I separate my configurations into [[./profiles][profiles]] (essentially system templates), i.e:
- [[./profiles/personal][Personal]] - Personal laptop/desktop
- [[./profiles/homelab][Homelab]] - Server or homelab
- [[./profiles/wsl][WSL]] - Windows Subystem for Linux

The profile can be conveniently selected in [[./flake.nix][the flake.nix]] by setting the =profile= variable.

More detailed information on these profiles is in the [[./profiles][profiles directory]].
